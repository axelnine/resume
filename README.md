## Resume Template - LaTeX

A single page one column resume for software developers. It uses the base latex templates and fonts to provide ease of use and installation when trying to update the resume. The different sections are clearly documented and custom commands are used to provide consistent formatting.

Each part is divided into a section by a separating comment. To run, please download the tex file and run it in a LateX editor. TexStudio is advised.
